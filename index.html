<h1> Hello World! </h1>

<p> At least there's an index page now </p>
<p> Yeah so FYI, if your USERNAME.githuhb.io repo has an index.html in it, I think it'll use that over anything else </p>
<p> if it doesn't, and has a README.md, it'll use that, and your site will look like markdown </p>
<p> and I think if it further has a _config.yml, it'll try to use it as a jekyll theme </p>
<p> gonna update this at some point </p>
